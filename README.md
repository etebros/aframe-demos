# aframe-demos
These are nothing but some experiments done for my university assignments in augmented reality.

## Exploring some a-frame basic possibilities

These are a couple of scenes showing how to:

* Use predefined environments
* Load assets to texturize primitives
* Animate objects both declaratively and using code
* Use portals to access another scene
* Import external objects (gltf and collada 3D models plus audio)
* Start embedded animations in gltf models
* Dynamically loading and unloading objects from scene
* Controlling audio playback.

 Want to see all these in action? Check the scenes [here](https://etebros.github.io/aframe-demos/).

 Code remarks are in Spanish. Translating them to English is in my backlog yet, sorry.

 ## Mixing image sources

 This scene combines a 360 photo shot at a real location and a couple of synthetic 360 images generated with 3DS Max and rendered in Arnold. As a matter of fact both 3DS Max images come from the same 3D model: the first one is texturized with photorealistic bitmaps, while the second one uses wireframe-like textures.

 The scene can be seen [here](https://etebros.github.io/aframe-demos/escena02.html).
